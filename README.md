# TELBlazor
TEL Blazor Component Library Package

# Purpose

Progressive components, that use the server prerendering in Global Wasm Blazor to ensure that if the user has no JS they will get html. And that html can be created to have working post actions.
The render cycle will hydrate the prerender and the post actions will be overrided by services injected in the components.
It is client side so the users browser will do the work.
